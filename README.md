# physical-chemistry-kinetics-oral-exam-question
This repository contains the student and instructor version on an oral exam question used in a physical chemistry course. The student version has omissions in the code that the students must fill in correctly to determine if the forward or reverse reactions (or both) follow Arrhenius behavior and calculate the activation energy as appropriate. There is no license on this file and feel free to use as a resource in your classroom as an activity or an exam question. This Jupyter notebook was adapted from the POGIL-PCL experiment "Can We Make Stew With These Beans?". https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ossqfG5WaMEFKYsbccHe5ElIQbD2p0yB
